# Project Title: Integrating Speech Recognition and Synthesis on ChatGPT

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a versatile system that combines Speech Recognition and GPT-2 models for real-time speech recognition and synthesis. The system accurately transcribes spoken words into text and generates human-like speech from the transcribed text, achieving high accuracy across diverse environments. 
This technology aims to enhance applications in customer service and accessibility tools, significantly improving user interaction.

## Features

**Speech Recognition:** Utilizes machine learning and deep learning models, including neural networks, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to accurately transcribe speech.


**Speech Synthesis:** Implements Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis technologies such as WaveNet or Deep Voice for high-quality speech generation.


**Model Optimization:** Focuses on optimizing algorithms for efficient, real-time performance across various computing platforms.

## Goals

--> Provide efficient transcription and natural-sounding speech.

--> Explore advanced models for further enhancements in accuracy and naturalness.
